# PhPsst

A PHP library for distributing (one time) passwords/secrets in a more secure way

## Installation
Add the package as a requirement to your `composer.json`:
```bash
$ composer require felixsand/PhPsst
```

## Usage
```php
<?php

use PhPsst\PassDist;

$storage = new FileStorage('data/passwords/', 10);
$phPsst = new PhPsst($storage);
$secret = $phPsst->store('my secret password');
echo 'The passwords ID and encryption key: ' . $secret;
echo 'The password: ' . $phPsst->retrieve($secret);
```

## Storage Classes
### FileStorage
The most basic of the storage classes is the FileStorage. It's also (generally) the most insecure and if you store a lot
of passwords there's a performance issue due to the garbage collector being very crude. It is however the easiest way
to try out the library and useful during development


## Requirements
- PHP 5.6 or above.
- Redis
